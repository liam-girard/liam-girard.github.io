# This is my GitHub Page
Hello! My name is Liam Girard and this is my GitHub page! This is a test of using GitHub's personal webpage feature, so I will utilize it for the most important reason! Sharing fun facts about plants of course!

## Bunchberry (*Cornus canadensis*)
Did you know that bunchberry is technically the fastest plant on Earth? It is in the family of dogwoods, and is a little herbaceous plant with a pretty flower. However, it has a mechanism for releasing pollen where when the flowers first open, the stamens are flicked upwards and shoot out the pollen in less than a millisecond with (according to NPR) about 800 times the force astronauts experience during takeoff. Even with the great amount of force applied, the pollen only launches a couple centimeters into the air.

## Northern white-cedar (*Thuja occidentalis*)
These are some of, if not the longest, lived tree in eastern North America. They can dominate a given site (often very wet or very dry sites with high pH) for thousands of years, as their main form of reproduction is layering. This vegetative (asexual) method of reproduction allows branches of a living tree to develop its own root system if they are laying in (particulary wet) soil. So, although individual trees typically don't reach thousands of years old (although there has been records of individuals reaching more than 1,000 years of age along cliff faces in Ontario), the area they inhabit could very likely have only had northern white-cedar dominating the area since post-glaciation!

Anyways, those are all the facts I'll share for now. Have a great day!
